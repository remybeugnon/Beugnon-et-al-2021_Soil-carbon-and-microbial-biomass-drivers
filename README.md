## Description:

All scripts used to built the models and figures of this paper. The
analyses were performed in R (version 4.1.3 2022-03-10)

## Files content:

Analysis-1.R: Script to test and plot the hypothesis 1: we expect tree
productivity and root functional trait identity and dissimilarity to
drive soil carbon concentrations.

Analysis-2.R: Script to test and plot the hypothesis 2: tree
productivity and root functional identity and dissimilarity effects on
soil carbon concentrations are expected to be mediated by microbial
biomass.

Analysis-3.R: Script to test and plot the hypothesis 3: tree
productivity and root functional identity and dissimilarity effects on
soil carbon concentrations and soil microbial biomass are expected to be
mediated by micro-environmental condition.
