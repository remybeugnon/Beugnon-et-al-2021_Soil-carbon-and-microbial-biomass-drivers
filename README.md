## Description: 
All scripts used to built the models and figures of this paper. The analyses were performed in R (version 4.0.3)

## Files content: 
Analysis-1.R: Script to test and plot the hypothesis 1 and 4: we expect tree productivity and root functional trait identity and dissimilarity to drive soil carbon concentrations and these effects to be scale dependent.

Analysis-2.R: Script to test and plot the hypothesis 2 and 4: tree productivity and root functional identity and dissimilarity effects on soil carbon concentrations are expected to be mediated by microbial biomass and these effects are expected to be scale dependent.

Analysis-3.R: Script to test and plot the hypothesis 3 and 4: tree productivity and root functional identity and dissimilarity effects on soil carbon concentrations and soil microbial biomass are expected to be mediated by micro-environmental condition and these effects are expected to be scale dependent.
